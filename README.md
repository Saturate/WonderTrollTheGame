# WonderTroll

This is a stupid game. Made for fun. It's just to test out Phaser 3, and Webpack 4.
Nothing more than this at this currrect stage.

The premise of the game is that you are a troll on a twitch stream.
You have to avoid the mods (Real mod faces falling down shooting bananas) for as long as possible.

Your score will be your time alive.

That's it.
